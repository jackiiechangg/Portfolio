Welcome to my data science and analytics portfolio repo! I’m passionate about using data to help others understand their surrounding environment, and this repo contains a collection of my projects showcasing my skills and experience across dashboards, machine learning, and vizualizations. Each project targets a different aspect of the analytics, from exploratory analysis and predictive modeling to insight communication. I designed and executed the Healthcare Dashboard and Predicting Customer Churn Factor projects individually, while Predicting Stress Levels was a group project with 4 other teammates. 

## Projects

### Predicting Customer Churn Factors
- **Question:** Which customer behaviors and operational factors most strongly drive churn?  
- **Methodology:** Classification modeling (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) evaluated using accuracy and ROC-AUC.  
- **Results:** Achieved **~89.6% accuracy (ROC-AUC 0.716)**, identifying payment failures, satisfaction, tenure, and engagement as key churn drivers to inform retention strategies.

### Healthcare Utilization & Provider Dashboard
- **Question:** How can hospital workload and utilization patterns be monitored to support operational decision-making?  
- **Methodology:** Power BI dashboard built on encounter-level healthcare data with custom DAX measures and interactive filters.  
- **Results:** Enabled clear visibility into admissions, length of stay, and provider workload patterns for stakeholder review.

### Predicting Stress Levels from Employee Factors 
- **Question:** Which workplace and lifestyle factors have the greatest impact on employee stress levels?  
- **Methodology:** Supervised classification models (k-NN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks) with preprocessing and permutation feature importance.  
- **Results:** Final k-NN model achieved **55.5% accuracy**, a **~5% improvement over baseline**, identifying experience level, industry, and remote work support as key stress drivers.
