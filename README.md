Hi, welcome to my portfolio! I'm passionate about using data to help to others better understand the world around them, and this repo contains a collection of my projects that showcase my analytical and technical skills across data cleaning, exploratory analysis, dashboarding, prediction/ classification modeling. I aim to use my skills to extract answers for real-life problems. All my projects relate to a larger question: how can we understand human behavior through numbers and use data to make better decisions in the future. 

The projects included in this repo cover different aspecs of analytics, from interactive dashboard and data vizualization to machine learning and classification/ predictive modeling. I independently designed and executed the Healthcare Utilization Dashboard and Customer Churn Factors projects. Predicting Stress Level was completed as a collaborative team project with four teammates. 

Feel free to reach out to me if you want to chat :) 

## Projects

### Predicting Customer Churn Factors
- **Question:** Which customer behaviors and operational factors in an organization most strongly drive churn?  
- **Methodology:** Classification modeling (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) evaluated using accuracy and ROC-AUC.  
- **Results:** Achieved **~89.6% accuracy (ROC-AUC 0.716)**, identifying payment failures, satisfaction, tenure, and engagement as key churn drivers that determine retention strategies.

### Healthcare Utilization & Provider Dashboard
- **Question:** How can hospital workload and utilization data be analyzed support data-driven operational decisions?
- **Methodology:** Power BI dashboard built on encounter-level healthcare data with custom DAX measures and interactive filters.  
- **Results:** Enabled clear visibility into admissions, length of stay, and provider workload patterns for stakeholder review.

### Predicting Stress Levels from Employee Factors 
- **Question:** Which workplace and lifestyle factors have the greatest impact on employee stress levels?  
- **Methodology:** Supervised classification models (k-NN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks) with preprocessing and permutation feature importance.  
- **Results:** Final k-NN model achieved **55.5% accuracy**, a **~5% improvement over baseline**, identifying experience level, industry, and remote work support as key stress drivers.
