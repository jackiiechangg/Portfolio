## Healthcare Utilization & Provider Dashboard

### Overview
This project analyzes hospital utilization and provider workload patterns using encounter-level healthcare data. The goal is to support operational decision-making by providing clear visibility into patient volume, resource usage, and provider distribution across hospitals.

---

### Problem Statement
Healthcare organizations manage complex workloads across providers and departments, making it difficult to quickly identify utilization trends, bottlenecks, and areas of strain. This dashboard addresses the question:

**How can hospital workload and utilization patterns be monitored to support data-driven operational decisions?**

---

### Data & Metrics
- Encounter-level healthcare data
- Key metrics include:
  - Admissions volume
  - Length of stay
  - Provider workload
  - Utilization patterns by facility and service type

---

### Methods
- Built a multi-page **Power BI dashboard** with:
  - Interactive slicers and filters
  - Drill-through functionality for deeper analysis
  - Custom **DAX measures** to summarize utilization and workload metrics
- Designed views to support both high-level monitoring and detailed operational review

---

### Results & Insights
- Enabled stakeholders to quickly assess hospital workload trends
- Improved visibility into provider utilization and patient flow
- Supported identification of high-demand areas and potential resource constraints

---

### Tools & Technologies
- Power BI  
- DAX  
- SQL (data preparation)
